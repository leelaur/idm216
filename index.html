            <h3> Background</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                 Kami is a beloved Korean food truck located at the heart of Drexel's campus in Philadelphia, PA.  This truck was used to create an ordering app, one 
                 that previously did not exist. Given a pre-made high fidelity prototype of the app's interface on Figma, our team of five worked to develop the prototype into a web product. 
                    My role as a UI/UX designer focused on conducting usability tests and make necessary design changes for the final product.

        <h3> Goals & Objectives</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                This project aims to build a web app that is easy and functional for customers to use as both first time and returning customer. The app should also have an enjoyable
                user experience that customers are likely to use again. It should follow these characteristics and be completed within the 10 week time frame.

        <h3> Process Overview </h3>
        <p class="indent">
            This project was developed in three stages: Alpha, Beta, and Final. Each stage started with a design which was then usability tested and interviewed with 6 partipants, a total of 18 people. The next stage would address the feedback from the test/interview.
            Before starting, we gathered data and designs from the last team to inform our decisions going forward.

        <h3> Understanding the user and the food truck</h3>
        <p class="indent">
           Before going into production, we compiled and updated previous work given to us about the brand's style and target audiences as a style tile and user persona, respectively. This was important for keeping designs relevant to our customers.

        <h2> Solution </h2>
</section>
    <section>

        <h3> Alpha </h3>
        <p class="indent">
           For the alpha stage, we wanted to focus on the core of the design. This meant validating the previous design's user task flow. We reversed the high fidelity screen designs
           to mid-fidelity to prioritize the functionality. Through usability tests and interviews with 6 people we learned that having the food item page load back to the home page after adding to the cart 
           did not fit the mental model of our particpants. They expected to be in the cart page so they could checkout immediatly. For this reason, we changed the flow to be on the cart page after adding to the cart. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/alpha.gif" alt="gif of alpha micro-interaction" class="gif alpha-gif" />
        <p class="indent">
            We also created a homepage that listed general information about the food truck like the location and fundraisers with the truck. However, many people became confused because they expected to start their order right away. In our interview, when asked what feature
            of the app they would most used, everyone said something related to ordering or viewing the menu. Many people didn't care

         <p class="indent">
            Another realization our group has was that most of our users used Apple phones which most commonly has the website bar on the bottom of the screen. This obstructs the menu fixed at the bottom. To also maintain responsiveness we turned the menu into a hamburger menu.

        <h3> Beta </h3>
        <p class="indent">
           For the beta stage, we started to bring in colors and images to our prototype. In another 6 interviews we got a majority of negative feedback on finding the order QR code after placing an order. Participants
           took longer time navigating from the confirmation page to the home page to the past orders page to find the QR code than they would have liked. As a solution, we made the QR code page accessible from the home page located visibly at the top using bright colors.
        </p>
        <img src="images/alpha.gif" alt="gif of alpha micro-interaction" class="gif alpha-gif" />
        <p class="indent">
            We also received positive feedback on the micro-interaction animation and graphics that made the interface fun. Following this we decided to emphasize the graphics we used by making it bigger and more visible on the pages.

        <h2> Results </h2>
    </section>
    <section class="bottom">
        <p> 
            Although the micro-interaction works as it is supposed to, there are bugs when the “pin” button is clicked too fast that the modals animation entering in and out break. For future iterations, I would focus on fixing this issue to accommodate for situations where it may quick clicking might occur.

        </p>

        <p>
            Through this project, I was able to push my creative and coding skills to come up with unique micro-interactions and develop them. I was successful in completing each phase within the time frame and with a function, and responsive product.
