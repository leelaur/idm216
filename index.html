            <h3> Background</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                Micro-interactions are visual feedback indicators which provide the users with enough knowledge to understand the function. 
                It also engages users and brings delight in small interactions. Over 10 weeks, I learned to mock-up and develop existing micro-interactions
                to improve upon and create meaningful interactions for users. 
            </p>
       
            <p class="indent">
                I chose Pinterest to redesign because of the potential to push the branding into the micro-interaction. On Pinterest, users “pin” images to save. 
                With the imagery of a pushpin and the action of pinning, I incorporated this into the animations of the final product.  
            </p>

        <h3> Problem</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
            <p class="indent">
                Pinterest uses good micro-interactions, so rather than coming up with something entirely new, I decided to find areas that could bring a unique flair 
                without losing the core function. Because Pinterest is a visual website, I also had to consider keeping the animations simple, so it doesn’t take away from the main content. 
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                Although working on this project for 10 weeks total, three levels of micro-interactions: alpha, beta and final, were given 2-3 weeks to conceptualize and develop. 
                Considering the short time frame, I had to manage my time and consider feasibility within the time frame without sacrificing the quality of a meaningful micro-interaction. 
            </p>

        <h3> Goals & Objectives</h3>
            <p class="indent">
                In this project, I aimed to create multiple micro-interactions forming an interactive experience that brings delight following the project timeline.

        <h2> Process & Insight </h2>
    </section>
    <section>

        <h3> Alpha</h3>
        <p class="indent">
            For my alpha micro-interaction, I originally chose the chick-fil-A button to build because the feedback was so subtle that it was hard to notice when interacting with it.
             To provide clear feedback, I made the shadow being used darker and animate the truck image to slide on the x-axis to give it movement on hover. Because I felt I couldn’t 
             add more to this micro-interaction for the next two phases, I did not continue further on the Chick-fil-A button. 
        </p>

        <h2> Solution </h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>
            The final build is the product of accumulated micro-interactions and evolved knowledge from each phase to improve on the next. This solution allows the user to hover on the image, pin to save, and view a modal to save and remove.

        <h2> Results </h2>
    </section>
    <section class="bottom">
        <p> 
            Although the micro-interaction works as it is supposed to, there are bugs when the “pin” button is clicked too fast that the modals animation entering in and out break. For future iterations, I would focus on fixing this issue to accommodate for situations where it may quick clicking might occur.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Through this project, I was able to push my creative and coding skills to come up with unique micro-interactions and develop them. I was successful in completing each phase within the time frame and with a function, and responsive product.
